name: "Publicly Accessible Event Grid Topics"
description: "Detects Event Grid Topics with public network access enabled"
severity: Medium
category: ["Public Access", "arg-scan"]
reportability: Automatic
triageNotes: |
  Potential Risk:
  - Event publishing endpoints exposed to the internet
  - Could enable unauthorized event injection or data interception
  - May allow event deletion or manipulation
  - Sensitive event data could be exposed

  Triage Guidance:
  - This finding confirms network-level accessibility from internet
  - Event Grid Topic access is protected by authentication keys
  - Manual testing required:
    1. Verify topic endpoint is accessible
    2. Check if authentication is enforced
    3. Review shared access policies
  - Consider: Does this topic need internet access?

  Remediation Considerations:
  - Disable public network access if not required
  - Implement IP restrictions for known event publishers
  - Use Azure Private Link for internal access
  - Rotate access keys regularly
  - Monitor event publishing attempts
