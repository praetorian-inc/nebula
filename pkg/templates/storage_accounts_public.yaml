name: Publicly Accessible Storage Accounts
description: Detects storage accounts with public network access enabled and default allow action
severity: High
category: Public Access
reportability: Automatic
triageNotes: |
  Potential Risk:
  - Public accessibility exposes storage endpoints to the entire internet
  - Could lead to unauthorized data access attempts
  - Potential for data exfiltration if misconfigured
  
  Triage Guidance:
  - This finding only confirms the storage account is accessible from the internet and not anonymous access
  - Additional manual testing is required to determine if anonymous/unauthorized access is possible
  - Readers do not have object-level access, some additional permissions or shoulder surfing may be required
