id: overprivileged_custom_roles
name: Custom Roles with Privilege Escalation Permissions
description: Detects custom role definitions that contain permissions allowing privilege escalation through role assignments, classic administrator changes, or role definition modifications
severity: High
category: Privilege Escalation
triageNotes: |
  Potential Risk:
  - Permissions that allow users to modify role assignments or definitions can lead to privilege escalation
  - Users could escalate their own privileges or grant elevated access to others
  - Classic Administrator write permissions are especially dangerous as they grant legacy full access
  
  Triage Guidance:
  - Check who is currently assigned these roles using role assignments
  - Validate privilege escalation using a simulated environment with the same permissions assigned
  - Check if role is used in PIM (Privileged Identity Management) for additional controls
