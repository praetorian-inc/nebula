name: Publicly Accessible Data Factories
description: Detects Azure Data Factory instances with public network access enabled
severity: High
reportability: Manual Triage 
triageNotes: |-
  Potential Risk:
  - Public accessibility exposes the Data Factory endpoints to the entire internet
  - Could lead to unauthorized access to data pipelines and their configurations
  - May expose sensitive connection information in pipeline metadata
  - Potential for unauthorized pipeline execution or modification
  
  Triage Guidance:
  - Verify additional fields such as ipRules and defaultAction to ensure public access is enabled 
  - This finding confirms the Data Factory is accessible from the internet but not anonymous access
  - Additional manual testing is required to determine if unauthorized access is possible
  - Review configured integrations and linked services for sensitive connections
