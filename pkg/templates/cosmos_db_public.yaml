name: Publicly Accessible Cosmos DB Accounts
description: Detects Cosmos DB accounts with public network access enabled
severity: High
category: Public Access
triageNotes: |
  Potential Risk:
  - Public accessibility exposes the database endpoint to the entire internet
  - Increases risk of brute force attacks and unauthorized access attempts
  
  Triage Guidance:
  - This finding only confirms the database is accessible from the internet and not anonymous access
  - Additional manual testing is required to determine if anonymous/unauthorized access is possible
