name: Publicly Accessible Log Analytics Workspaces
description: Detects Log Analytics workspaces with public network access enabled for ingestion or query
severity: High
category: ["Public Access", "arg-scan"]
reportability: Manual Triage
triageNotes: |
  Important Context:
  Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces (Log Analytics Workspaces) does not allow anonymous access; all access is controlled through Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication and Azure role-based access control (RBAC). There is no supported configuration or documented method to permit unauthenticated or anonymous access to the workspace itself, to the logs within, or to ingestion endpoints.

  Potential Risk:
  - Public accessibility exposes log data and queries to potential unauthorized access
  - Could lead to sensitive data exposure if misconfigured
  - May allow unauthorized ingestion of data
  - Potential for excessive resource consumption through public queries

  Triage Guidance:
  - This finding confirms the workspace allows public network access for ingestion and/or query operations
  - Review if public access is required for both ingestion and query operations
  - Validate if any IP restrictions or private endpoints are configured
  - Check workspace access control and data export settings
