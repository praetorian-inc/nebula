name: "Publicly Accessible Databricks Workspace"
description: "Detects Azure Databricks workspaces with public network access enabled"
severity: High
category: ["Public Access", "arg-scan"]
reportability: Automatic
triageNotes: |
  Potential Risk:
  - Databricks workspace accessible from the internet
  - Could enable unauthorized access to data analytics environment
  - May expose notebooks, data, and code execution capabilities
  - Sensitive data processing pipelines could be compromised
  - Cluster compute resources could be abused

  Triage Guidance:
  - This finding confirms network-level accessibility from internet
  - Databricks access is protected by Azure AD authentication
  - Manual testing required:
    1. Verify workspace URL is accessible
    2. Check if Azure AD authentication is enforced
    3. Review workspace access controls and permissions
    4. Test REST API endpoint accessibility
  - Consider: Can workspace be restricted to corporate networks?

  Remediation Considerations:
  - Disable public network access if not required
  - Enable No Public IP (NPIP) for cluster nodes
  - Use Azure Private Link for internal access
  - Implement IP access lists for workspace access
  - Enable Azure AD Conditional Access policies
  - Use VNet injection for cluster isolation
  - Monitor workspace access and query execution
  - Review and restrict workspace permissions
